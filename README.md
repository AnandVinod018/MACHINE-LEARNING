K-means using Microsoft Excel

For this project,k-means has been implemented on Microsoft Excel.Any dataset can be taken into consideration for this project.But the dataset shpuldn't have any labels in it(should be an unlabelled dataset).The datasets considered for this project by us are the IRIS dataset as well as the mall customer dataset.There are many additional packages that are available in Microsoft Excel for implementing k-means like calaculation of cluster centres as well as finding the optimum cluster centers.
Only one package has been used here that is the Solver add-in package which is available in Excel.This package helps us in obtaining the optimum cluster centeres.

When do we stop solving for k-means?  OR    What is the stopping condition for k-means?
We stop when the distance between the clusters do not change or the cluster centres remain the same.

For both the datasets almost 5 to 6 different clusters have been selected and k-means is performed for the respective clusters.
